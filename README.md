# COVID-Infection-Risk-in-Households
<h1>Estimating the Probability of Infection For COVID-19 in Symptomatic and Non-symptomatic Individuals</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I quantified the secondary attack rate (SAR) by enforcing a prior and likelihood distribution across data from k epidemiological studies.
Then, I constructed a posterior distribution using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to quantify infection risk. 
Ultimately, the goal is to identify the regions with lower SAR to investigate what contributed to their relative success, and those with a higher SAR to know which areas are in urgent need of intervention to slow the spread.
